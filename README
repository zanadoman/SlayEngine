Wizard Engine

This is a simple 2D cross-platform game engine built around Simple DirectMedia
Layer 2 (SDL2). https://www.libsdl.org/

The goal of this library is to make game development accessible to anyone who
can code in C++ and doesn't want to tinker with GUI. Therefore, this engine
serves as a high-level wrapper around SDL2 while keeping the abstraction low and
the performance high. The stable version is still in progress (about 70%).

Officially supported platforms:
- Windows (x86_64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Android (x86_64, AArch64)
- Web (x86)

Dependencies:
- Clang
- Android NDK (for Android development only)
- Emscripten (for Web development only)
- CMake
- Gradle (for Android development only)
- Rustup (for server development only)
