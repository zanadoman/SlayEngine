Wizard Engine

This is a simple 2D cross platform game engine built around Simple DirectMedia
Layer 2. https://www.libsdl.org/

The goal of this library is to make game development accessible to anyone who
can code in C++ and doesn't want to tinker with UI. Therefore this engine
serves as a high-level wrapper around SDL2 while keeps the abstraction low
and the performance high. The stable version is still in progress. (about 70%)
